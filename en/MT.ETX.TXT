I'm selling a blue key at a bargain
price of 50 gold! Deal?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
The tower has 50 floors and consists
of 5 blocks, each with 10 floors.
Posted to each block is a boss ruling
that whole area, whom you must defeat
in order to obtain access to higher
floors.

|
I'm selling 5 keys at a package price
of 50 gold! Deal?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
When offering gold to an altar, it's
recommended to raise your DEF instead
of ATK. However, if you don't raise
your ATK at all, there might be some
enemies that you can't ever defeat
later on.

|
I'm selling a rare red key for 800
gold! Deal?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
Did you notice the hidden tunnels on
9F, 16F, and 18F?

|
I'm selling a blue key for 200 gold!
Deal?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
A Cross in your possession can double
your ATK when fighting with zombies
and the Vampire. Especially, Vampire
seems invincible without the Cross.
It should be somewhere on the higher
floors that...

|
I'll buy your keys for 100 gold each.
Do you wanna sell them?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
|
I'm selling a set of 4 keys plus a
blue key for 1000 gold! Deal?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
The tower is 50 floors high, but in
reality, you can only go up to 49F.

|
I'm selling 3 keys at a huge deal for
200 gold! First come, first served!
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
Wherever there are gatemen, there's
a gate. In turn, if there is a gate,
there will always be enemies guarding
the gate on the same floor. So, ... 

|
The price is 2000 gold, but it's for
3 blue keys. Deal?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
There is an item called "Lucky Gold"
somewhere in this tower. With that
in you possession, it can supposedly
double your earnings from defeating
enemies.

|
For 1000 gold, I can raise your HP by
2000 pt.
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
The Sacred Shield seems to have the
power to screen you from the magic
attacks of wizards... However, it's
said to be hidden on a phantom floor.

|
Yike! Thank you for helping me out.
Please take this as a small token of
my gratitude.
       (Received 1000 gold!)

|
Would you like to buy a super rare
item, Super Mattock, for 4000 gold?
    @ Yes
    @ No

|
If you plan on defeating the Dragon,
you must have the Holy Sword, Holy
Shield, and Dragon Slayer in hand;
besides, you've also got to attain
sufficiently high levels.

and expected damage to you on this floor.

I'll bestow this Orb of Hero on you.
This will not only enable the save
function, but also allow you to look
up the monsters' abilities on your
current floor and predict the battle
damage. Please use it effectively.

|
In this tower, there are doors that
can be opened by keys, but besides
them, there are also "gates," which
I assume won't open untill the mons-
ters guarding them are defeated. 

|
If you make a purchase from a mer-
chant, they may provide valuable in-
formation afterwards.

|
In this block, there are two places
where you can get a red key.

|
In this block, without raising your
ATK several times at an altar, the
monsters called "Rock" would be too
formidable to defeat easily. So, be-
ware of that.

|
Well, well. You've found me. As a
reward, this "Elixir" is now yours.
This potion can raise your HP accor-
ding to your current ATK and DEF. So
of course, the later you use it, the
better the effect will be.

|
If you can make good use of the four
hidden tunnels on this floor, you can
go upstairs without the need to fight
strong enemies.

|
In this block lives the Archsorcerer,
the proprietor of the tower. Fighting
him now is tantamount to suicide. The
right solution is to go to the higher
block now without confronting him.

|
The dual wielding swordsmen have an
incredibly high ATK. By fighting them
head on, you'll suffer from a great
damage. You'd better not fight them
till you can achieve a one turn kill.

|
Haste makes waste.

|
In order to obtain the items in the
warehouse on this floor, a mattock
is necessary.

|
At 3 o'clock, Warp Staff will appear.

|
At the stage of reaching this floor,
if you have an HP of 1500, an ATK of
80, a DEF of 98, as well as 5 keys
and a blue key, then it can be viewed
as an ideal status.

|
Oh! Thank you for helping me out. In
return, I'll raise your ATK and DEF
by 3%.
     (ATK and DEF got raised!)

|
Magicians perform magic attacks when
adjacent to you. Sorcerers perform an
attack that halves your HP when you
get flanked in between them. Beware
of the latter case, as a higher HP of
yours can lead to a larger damage.

|
44F of this tower is a phantom floor.
It can't be reached by simply using
stairs. Unless you warp the space, it
is impossible to get there.

|
41F shows perfect bilateral symmetry.
So, ...

|
It's said that the shape of 5 pips on
a dice has the power to seal the evil
magic. You'd better keep this in mind
when fighting the boss of this block.

|
|
|
Haha, you've made it here. Incredible
but in such a case, I'll fight you
directly... However, I'd like to see
how capable you are before that! Come
out! My skeleton soldiers!

|
Hmm, impressive... But I won't let
you go on anymore! Here, you'll meet
your demise! Well, come on!!!

Skeleton: Ugh... Can't believe that
I'm beaten by you... However, the
floors from now on will be filled
with monsters and traps that are
incomparably stronger than ever, so
just face your doom with fear...

|
Yo! We meet again. You're amazing for
defeating the boss of this block. It
had troubled me that I couldn't go to
higher floors. Oh right, I heard that
there's a shield on 11F and a sword
on 17F, but it's best if you go for
the sword first. In doing so, you've
got to dodge the enemies along the
way. Anyways, see you later!

|
|
|
Welcome to "Tower of the Sorcerer."
You are the 100th invader. Normally,
I'd have my minions deal with you,
but this time, I'll specially fight
you myself. Curse your misfortune.

|
What!? Owwww!!?

|
...

|
...Hey...

|
...Hey! Wake up!

|
Are you OK? You were caught and put
into this prison by the Sorcerers,
and you've been unconscious till now.
But you got lucky! I happened to
finish making an escape tunnel just
when you got here. Anyways, I'm about
to escape right now. Come with me!

|
OK, I've got to leave now. By the
way, it looks like your swords and
shields were taken away, and it's
unwise to wander around here unarmed.
I remember there is a sword on 5F and
a shield on 9F. You'd better consider
getting them first of all. Well then,
see you later!

|
|
|
|
Yo! Are you OK? The Giant Octopus is
blocking the road and has been trou-
bling me. But finally, this tunnel's
been completed. I think you'd better
also avoid fighting the Octopus for
now. Alright, see you then!

|
Ho, it's you - the braveman who beat
the Skeleton and invaded my territo-
ry... But don't be naive and equate
me with the lowly Skeleton. I'll now
show you my undead power. Come!

|
Ugh... I never thought that even I
would lose... Seems that your power's
the real deal... But power of this
level will never be a match for that
of the great Archsorcerer. So just
revel in your momentary triumph...

|

|
Phew, the tunnel's finally done. Huh?
It's you again. Good timing, isn't
it? I've just made another tunnel,
and feel free to use it as you like.

|
The captured princess and the last
boss are both in this block. But it
might be too early to plan for that.

|
Argh! The tunnel hasn't been comp-
leted yet... If you had waited a bit,
you wouldn't have got to use an item.
The plan's got messed up... Ah no,
never mind.

|
|
|
|
You must be the braveman who beat the
bosses of Blocks 1 and 2 and came to
this point. But this is where it all
ends! As the boss of this block, I'll
chop off your head myself! Hands up!

|
Ugh... I'll let you go for now... But
if you can make it to 40F, I'll fight
you seriously then. Remember that and
be prepared!

|
|
|
|
You finally came. This time won't be
like before! I'll repay you for that
humiliation 10x over! Ghost Soldiers!

|
Humph, those are just small fry! Now
charge, Soldiers!

|
We're not done yet! Swordsmen charge!

|
Heck! But how about this! Knights,
charge!

|
Ugh...My minions... N-never will I
spare you! This time, I won't show
mercy on you! Prepare yourself!

|
Cough... That's enough for this time
... Huff huff... I'll let it slide
for now... But next time, I won't go
easy on you and will fight you seri-
ously! Be ready!

|
Yo! We meet again. Thanks for beating
the gatemen here and saving me. I got
caught again, and unfortunately, I
was locked up in this back cell this
time. Anyways, I've been digging a
tunnel in front of the Dragon on 35F.
I'll open it up very soon, so just
go ahead first.

|
Just go ahead to 35F first, and I'll
catch up.

|
Oh, you're here. Good timing - I've
just opened up this tunnel, through
which you can sneak behind the Dragon
and up the stairs.

|
The boss of this block, Golden Knight
is domineering despite being weak, so
he seems to be disliked by Vice Gen-
eral of the tower, Zeno the Sorcerer.

|
Golden Knight:
Ah...! Lord Zeno... I almost captured
the braveman, but he escaped. Please,
forgive me...

|
Zeno the Sorcerer:
He escaped...? Wasn't it you who es-
caped! You shameless maggot! Cowards
like you have no place in this tower!
Here you die!

|
Golden Knight:
Eek! No, please forgive...Gulp! Owww!

|
Zeno the Sorcerer:
Sorry for the unsavory sight. How-
ever, rest assured that I'm not like
this scumbag. If you manage to come
to me alive, I'll personally fight
you myself. I'm looking forward...

|
Unused paragraph

|
Well done, you're here at last. Let
me praise you for that. Now as I
promised, I'll be personally facing
you myself. Alright, come at me.

|
Alas... This formation... Oh no!

|
|
|
BEEP... K-I-L-L...T-H-E...B-R-A-V-E-
M-A-N...

|
BEEP... THE-TIME... HAS-COME... THE-
CHOSEN ONE...IF YOU-ARE-NOT-AFRAID OF
DEATH... GO-THROUGH-THE-GATE OF-SPACE
AND-TIME... AND...COME...TO...ME...

Braveman: This... It's just a doll!

|
You are...! How can you be in such a
place!

|
Well, la di da. There's only one way
to explain why I'm here. That expla-
nation is...!

|
Ah...! You are Zeno! How come you're
still alive!?

|
Zeno:
You really think that I would ever
get defeated in such a way? It was
simply a test of your abilities as
a warrior.

|
What!?... What do you mean! Why did
you do such things to me!?

|
Zeno:
You possess the Sacred Sword, "Weap-
ner," whereas I have the Omniscient
Staff, "Intellion." It's said that
whoever unites these two powers can
gain great wisdom... The great cause,
however, requires a warrior who can
fully wield the power of that sword.

|
Are you saying that I'm the one...
The "warrior"!?

|
Zeno: Indeed... However, your skills
were inadequate to master that Sacred
Sword "Weaponer." That's why I spread
false information, set various traps
in this tower, and waited for you to
come. And now, just as I had planned,
you've come this far with sufficient
power to handle the Sacred Sword.

|
So you're saying that even the rumor
of the princess being kidnapped was
just a trap to lure me here!?

|
Zeno: Exactly. That said, once I take
away your power, this farce will come
to an end...
        The time has come...
      With my omniscient power,
  I shall shatter the Sacred Sword
      and gain great wisdom...
Come! Warrior of the Sacred Sword!
